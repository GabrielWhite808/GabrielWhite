In the software engineering class I took at UH Manoa this semester I learned an extensive amount of concepts in the field of software development and engineering. While the majority of the practical application of the material I was able to gather from the semester related to the web development project I completed, the crucial ideas I learned stretch beyond the field of web development. This essay will analyze a few key concepts I learned and their application to the vast world of software engineering. 

<h2>Configuration Management</h2>

One major concept that I studied was configuration management. <a href=“https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/configuration_management”> The Computer Security Resource Center</a> defines configuration management as, “A collection of activities focused on establishing and maintaining the integrity of information technology products and information systems, through control of processes for initializing, changing, and monitoring the configurations of those products and systems throughout the system development life cycle.”


<h2>Coding Standards</h2>
