Imagine you are a chef given a task to create an exquisite dish of crab-stuffed filet mignon with whiskey peppercorn sauce. Instead of using a recipe to guide you or give inspiration, you decide to create the dish from scratch. After a few failed attempts at the dish, you realize that you have run out of time and your boss is expecting a completed meal. If you had used a recipe, it would have served as a guide and allowed you to make modifications to complete the task in an efficient manner. This example shows how important recipes are as a template of sorts for making meals. In the same way, design patterns act as a template for developing applications in the field of software development. They save vital time by providing developers with reusable functionality structures that can be used in many applications. This essay will delve into what design patterns are, the importance of understanding the design patterns used in a chosen platform, and specific examples of design patterns in Meteor.
