Imagine you are a chef given a task to create an exquisite dish of crab-stuffed filet mignon with whiskey peppercorn sauce. Instead of using a recipe to guide you or give inspiration, you decide to create the dish from scratch. After a few failed attempts at the dish, you realize that you have run out of time and your boss is expecting a completed meal. If you had used a recipe, it would have served as a guide and allowed you to make modifications to complete the task in an efficient manner. This example shows how important recipes are as a template of sorts for making meals. In the same way, design patterns act as a template for developing applications in the field of software development. They save vital time by providing developers with reusable functionality structures that can be used in many applications. This essay will delve into what design patterns are, the importance of understanding the design patterns used in a chosen platform, and specific examples of design patterns in Meteor.

<h2>Design Patterns</h2>

Design patterns in software engineering serve as templates for developers. By providing pre-determined structures, they allow developers to recreate patterns of behaviors with minor modifications. This parallels how a chef can make minor modifications to a recipe instead of starting from scratch. Now that developers have this framework, they are able to implement changes much faster. This allows them to spend more time on fixing glitches and implementing more complex aspects of their programs instead of spending countless hours working on the bare bone models of their application that design patterns would have supplied. This means that utilizing the design patterns of a platform allows developers to be much more efficient and productive.

<h2>Importance of Understanding Design Patterns</h2>

While design patterns do serve as a great tool for software developers to use, it is important to understand that not all are created equal. Before using a certain platform which utilizes design patterns, it is important to know what the design patterns used are and how they will apply to the application being created. For example, it would not be advantageous to use a design pattern geared towards user-interface and interaction for an application that is almost entirely used for back-end database functionality. This would be similar to a chef using a recipe for a sandwich to make a soup. The chef would have to rely on their own ability to make the soup and the recipe would likely make the process more complicated. As a result of different design patterns being implemented in various platforms, it is vital to understand and match the application's goal with a framework that suits it. This is something I have stumbled upon in my own interactions with the design patterns of Meteor.
