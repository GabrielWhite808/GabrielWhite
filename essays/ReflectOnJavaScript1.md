  So far in the ICS 314 class I have learned and recapped information in relation to software engineering. The main areas of learning so far have been about Javascript 
and the athletic software engineering system. In this essay, I will discuss what I have learned about Javascript, how Javascript compares to other languages, and 
describe athletic software engineering and its benefits.


  Firstly, what have I learned about Javascript? The two courses assigned as ICS 314 homework were not the first Javascript courses I have taken. I have previously 
completed courses on Khan academy and codecademy that taught Javascript. One Khan academy class I took was an introduction course that focused on the applications of 
Javascript when used to draw on a canvas. The course also covered essential coding concepts such as loops, functions, and variables. I also completed a course on Khan 
academy centered around Javascript’s use in relation to HTML, CSS, and web-application development. As I had a bit of previous experience with Javascript, the courses 
assigned by ICS 314 served as a good recap of the language’s ins and outs. I relearned Javascript syntax as well as functionality specific to Javascript. While the 
Basic Javascript course was mainly review, I learned a lot of new information in the ES6 course. For example, being able to declare functions with arrows, the use of 
imports and exports, and promises were all concepts that I had never covered in a prior Javascript course.


  Not only have I learned quite a bit about Javascript’s syntax and functionality, I have also begun forming an opinion on Javascript’s uses in comparison to other 
programming languages. The main difference I have noticed between Javascript and other languages such as Java and C is functionality. In Javascript, the functionality 
is much more intuitive than in other languages. Additionally, functionality is not strictly regulated and limited like it is in Java. For example, in Javascript, 
arrays are not stuck to a set size like they are in Java. Another example is the fact that variables and items in an array are not required to be a specific type in 
Javascript. In Java, such restrictions are in place. Another benefit that Javascript has over other languages is its Event-Driven nature. This means that Javascript 
is geared towards events such as a click or the user inputting data. Event-Driven Programming (EDP) allows for more dynamic outcomes and a more responsive environment.
However, the Event-Driven nature of Javascript also has its drawbacks. By definition, EDP shifts the focus to events and will invariably give much control to the user.
While this can definitely be an asset to software development, it can also be a detriment. The flexibility of Javascript can lead to developers having to deal with 
extremely complex outcomes. In fact, because the language is so flexible, it is hard to account for and properly handle the countless potential outcomes. This could 
lead to bugs, glitches, and an unsafe or hackable environment. Overall, however, the flexibility and intuitive functionality of the language makes it an overall great 
pick for software engineering.

In this class, I have not only learned about Javascript but have also been introduced to the athletic software engineering system. Athletic software engineering 
draws an analogy between learning programming and exercise regimens like crossfit. This system utilizes repeated and intense practices called WODs that challenge 
how much the student has learned about a programming language or environment. These Workouts of the Days (WODs) are both stressful and enjoyable. As they impose a 
time limit to complete the given tasks, it requires prior knowledge, focus, and skill to finish the task. I find them enjoyable because I like challenges that 
stimulate my problem solving skills. Overall, I believe that the athletic software engineering system will be quite helpful in developing my coding competency, 
software development and problem solving skills.

Up until this point in class, I have gained quite a bit of knowledge of Javascript, how it compares to other programming languages, and the system of athletic 
software engineering. I am looking forward to the challenges this ICS 314 will present and hope to be well prepared for possible internships and a career in the 
technology field after completion of the class.
