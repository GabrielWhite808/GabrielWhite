Since middle school, I have been intrigued by the problem-solving aspects of coding. Whether taking introductory coding classes on Khan academy in 7th grade, learning HTML, CSS, Javascript, and JQuery in a my homeschool co-op, or competing in the Scratch-based Science Olympiad event “Game On”, I have always enjoyed the challenge that programming brings. Currently, my coding endeavors include completing difficult LeetCode problems, writing programs that prove discrete-math theories, and my latest enterprise, learning software engineering. Software engineering marks the next step in my path to improving my coding abilities. In this essay, I will discuss the aspects of software engineering that interest me and the skills I wish to develop by pursuing study in this field.
	
 
 Firstly, why am I interested in software engineering? To truly answer this question requires looking back at my interests in coding in general. I enjoy solving problems including sudoku, chess tactics, kenken, riddles, and many others. I appreciate the challenge of having a task, analyzing it, and then solving it using a given set of rules. My interest in coding and software engineering stems from this same appreciation. I love the frustration of facing a difficult coding task and the reward when the code finally works as intended. I look forward to facing similar challenges in software engineering and hope they will produce a fertile learning environment for growth in my chosen field of computer science. 
	
 
 With that being said, there are few specific skills that I hope to gain through further study in software engineering. One skill I wish to garner is the ability to create, develop, and deploy a website. Another skill I want to improve on is my coding problem solving skills. Not only will I enjoy the challenge, I also want to have the ability to handle complex coding software tasks from a consumer or boss in my future career.
	
 
 Overall, software engineering is the next destination in my journey of computer science. I will continue to thrive on the challenges it raises and gain skills that I hope to carry over to a career in the computer science field. As always, my intrigue in coding will continue, and I cannot wait for the next challenge.
