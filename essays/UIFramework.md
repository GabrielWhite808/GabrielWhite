Removing redundancies is the name of the game in software engineering. As a software engineer, if you ever find yourself repeating the same action, whether it is writing a certain line of code, setting up a certain type of document, or modifying the style of a certain element in a webpage, there is a way to do it faster. Programmers have become experts at streamlining every process possible. From IDEs, keyboard shortcuts, reusable functions, built-in consoles, code autofills, easy-access debuggers, and the list continues, programmers are always striving to shorten the time they spend at the keyboard for any given task. Nobody wants to spend hours doing the same thing over and over again and if software engineers know anything it is that efficiency is key. 


As the saying goes, necessity is the mother of invention, and the world of web development is no exception to this maxim. In the case of web development, programmers became tired of writing CSS style sheets from scratch for each web application and UI frameworks were born. 


<h2>What is a UI Framework?</h2>

As the name suggests, a UI framework is a collection of libraries, styles, and preprogrammed elements that can be used when developing a user interface or web application. A few of the most popular frameworks include Bootstrap, Semantic-UI, and React. While each framework has its own advantages and utility, they all offer a multitude of tools to developers that reduce the amount of time spent at the keyboard. This essay will delve into the benefits of using a UI framework as well as the importance of knowing them as a software developer.
