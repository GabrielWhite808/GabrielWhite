This project implemented both front-end and back-end components of a records database. It also properly handled invalid input and allowed for user data to be multiple lines. 

Dedicated hours to writing pseudocode, traced the pseudocode to verify correctness, and translated into C++ to create the database. 

Developed numerous functions to add, delete, find, and print all the records of the people in the database. The database also saved the records and allowed for the database to retrieve them in future executions of the program.
