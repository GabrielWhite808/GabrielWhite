The project that my team and I created is a portal for students or organizations to propose projects, have those projects reviewed, approved, and showcased. This project was created in accordance to the specifications of UH Professors Anthony Peruma and Dan Port. The portal establishes a framework for classes with project formats similar to ICS 314 to expidite the project generation, selection, and approval process.
